How to do server auth without storing the key/session id in the game table?
I think there needs to be as little tables as possible for this so that it doesnt get confusing
There should be a DB in the app.ts file
One for session ids with usernames
One for games
Usernames must be unique and not be used in the session id table already
The start up screen has a login page
Enter your username
It registers a session id in the server
Takes you to a "dashboard" page
You can click matchmake and its cool
wow
